## RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION

|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Metrics don't improve as expected | Low (17%) | Medium | Quick Wins proven in similar businesses; conservative estimates |
| Mobile issues on certain devices | Low (5%) | Low | Tested on iOS/Android; responsive design verified |

- A/B test copy variations (already tracked)
- Run additional CRO improvements (MS-01 through MS-04 planned for Q1)
- Analyze user behavior via PostHog to identify new opportunities

---

## QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: When will we see the revenue impact?**
A: Form completion improvements should show within 1-2 weeks of deployment. Organic traffic gains from Phase 3 will show within 4-8 weeks as search engines re-index.

**Q: Is this a permanent improvement or temporary?**
A: These are permanent structural improvements. The better messaging, navigation, and pages will continue to work indefinitely unless we change them.

**Q: What about the remaining phases (4-5)?**
A: Phases 4-5 include additional visual polish and SEO/performance optimizations. Not critical for revenue, but recommended for premium positioning.

**Q: How much should we invest in Q1 2026?**
A: Recommended: €20k-€30k for maximum ROI projects (Availability Checker, Price Calculator, A/B Testing). These could drive +€180k-€300k additional annual revenue.

**Q: What's our biggest opportunity right now?**
A: The Availability Checker tool (Q1 2026) - 35% of visitors leave because they don't know if you're available. Solving this alone could be +25-30% conversion improvement.
