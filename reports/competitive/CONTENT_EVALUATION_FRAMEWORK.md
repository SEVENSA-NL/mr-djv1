## NOTES ON FAIR EVALUATION

### Objectivity Principles
- **Evidence-based**: Every score requires specific examples
- **Consistent**: Same standards applied to all competitors
- **Context-aware**: Consider target market and positioning
- **Honest**: No inflating own scores or deflating competitors

### Common Biases to Avoid
- **Recency bias**: Don't favor what you saw most recently
- **Confirmation bias**: Don't seek evidence that confirms pre-existing beliefs
- **Halo effect**: One strong element doesn't make everything strong
- **Horns effect**: One weak element doesn't make everything weak

### Quality Control
- Blind scoring (hide competitor names during evaluation when possible)
- Second reviewer validation
- Spot-check 3-5 scores per competitor for accuracy
